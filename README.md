AI-Enabled Car Parking System


Project Overview


This project demonstrates an AI-enabled car parking system developed using OpenCV, implemented as part of the Naan Mudhalvan scheme in collaboration with IBM. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to efficiently manage and monitor parking spaces, enhancing user experience and optimizing space utilization.

Objectives


To create a smart parking solution that automatically detects available parking spaces.


To provide real-time information to users regarding parking availability.


To develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and monitoring.


Technologies Used


Programming Language: Python


Libraries:


Computer Vision: OpenCV


Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)


Data Handling: NumPy, Pandas


User Interface: Flask or Tkinter (if applicable)


Features


Parking Space Detection: Real-time detection of available parking slots using video feed.


User Notifications: Alerts users about parking availability through a web interface or mobile application.


Data Visualization: Displays occupancy statistics and trends over time.
